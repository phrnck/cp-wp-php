					<h3>Lake Escapes</h3>
					<h4>Paddle, swim and float your way to serenity this summer</h4>
					<p>What better way to wile away the summer than with a long, lazy weekend on a lake? The three included here offer peace and quiet, natural beauty and affordable amenities, and have somehow managed to stay off the beaten path. Two, in New Hampshire and the Adirondacks, are far enough to warrant an extra few days away, and another, in the Poconos, will feel like a proper vacation stretched over three relaxing days. So dive in.</p>
					<p>Tupper Lake, Adirondacks, New York</p>
					<p>There’s a joke that residents of Tupper Lake like to tell. It goes like this: What’s the population of Tupper Lake?</p>
					
					<p>Answer: Mostly spruce and hemlock.</p>
					<p>It’s not much of an exaggeration. Towering spruce, hemlock, beech and white pine trees surround this Adirondack village some 40 miles west of Lake Placid. Five hours by car from the city, the Tupper Lake area is a canoer’s paradise. The lake itself is the source of 10 rivers, and flows into several smaller bodies of water, including Raquette Pond to the north (which leads into the Raquette River, the second-longest river in New York) and Simon Pond to the east.</p>
					
					<p>Bordering the Adirondacks High Peaks wilderness forest, Tupper Lake offers miles of hiking and biking trails, a thread of waterways perfect for short or extended canoe and kayak trips, a golf course, antique shops and restaurants. It’s also near the Hudson River Gorge, one of the best whitewater runs in the Northeast.</p>
					
					<p>But it’s not likely to remain an insider secret for long. Plans are in place to relaunch the Big Tupper ski center, link Tupper with Lake Placid via scenic railway, open an Adirondacks natural history museum and build homes and condominiums in the coming year.</p>
					
					<p>“We want to see Tupper Lake become the crossroads of the Adirondacks,” said Mayor Sandra Strader. “We know we have to grow, but we want to keep that small-town atmosphere.”</p>
					
					<p>Tupper Lake’s tiny main drag, with a handful of restaurants and bars, isn’t much of a tourist attraction — the beautiful surroundings are the area’s main draw. I set out to explore Tupper on a recent weekend and went first to Mount Arab, a nearby mountain with a wide path to its summit that rewards hikers with an expansive view of sparkling water below. I spent the night at the Timber Lodge, a refurbished Adirondack-style motel with cozy rooms that boast a collection of hand-crafted cedar furniture available for purchase. The following day, I joined a whitewater rafting tour of the gorge.</p>
					
					<p>The 17-mile stretch spills through unspoiled wilderness where eagles, coyotes, deer and trout abound. Armed with a paddle, I climbed aboard a rubber boat to tackle rapids with nicknames like Osprey Nest, Black Hole and the Big Nasty.</p>
					
					<p>For those who prefer to swim, there’s a lifeguard-manned public beach at adjacent Little Wolf Lake, which also has 45 campsites. But one of the great things about Tupper Lake (and the Adirondacks in general) is easy access to water. In most places on Tupper Lake and the nearby ponds and rivers, visitors can simply park their cars by the side of the road and set up their beach chairs. A municipal boat launch in Tupper Lake village is open to everyone.</p>
					
					<p>After my whitewater trip, I had a fine dinner at the Wawbeek resort and lodge, a full-service refuge on nearby Upper Saranac Lake with its own hiking and nature trails, swimming beach and restaurant. The Wawbeek’s cozy rooms are outfitted with working fireplaces, decks and Adirondack chairs.</p>
					
					<p>On Sunday, I rented a canoe from Raquette River Outfitters in Tupper Lake and drove a few miles to Horseshoe Lake. As I floated over reeds and rocks and listened to wind blowing through the massive evergreens, I realized that Nancy Howard, one of the Wawbeek’s owners, had described the region well when she said: “I like to think of New York City as the big apple and the rest of the state as the tree.” Donna Petrozzello</p>
					
					<p>Lake Wallenpaupack, Poconos, Pennsylvania</p>
					
					<p>Pennsylvania’s Lake Wallenpaupack welcomed its first summer crowd back in 1929. The lake was a gift to the state from Pennsylvania Power and Light, which donated nearly 6,000 acres for swimming, boating and fishing when it dammed the valley’s tiny Wallenpaupack Stream.</p>
					
					<p>Among the first to welcome New Yorkers to the new lake — it’s just 100 miles from the Holland Tunnel (about 2 1/2 hours by car) — were George and Marjorie Ehrhardt, who turned their Pocono mountains homestead into the Silver Birches Inn. For just $15 a week, the Ehrhardts served three meals a day to guests who spent afternoons playing horseshoes by the lake.</p>
					
					<p>Prices have gone up a bit, and the much larger inn has changed its name to Ehrhardt’s. But Lake Wallenpaupack still has the same small-town charm and reasonable prices that drew those first guests years ago.</p>
					
					<p>As the number of visitors to Wallenpaupack has grown, so has the surrounding community. With 52 miles of shoreline, the lake is the state’s second largest, and the area is dotted with typical summer businesses — cottages and motels, ice cream stands and sub shops and a handful of affordable restaurants offering cocktails or Saturday supper.</p>
					
					<p>Wallenpaupack’s peaceful disposition is preserved by its secluded location, smack in the middle of some of Pennsylvania’s best parklands. Within a few miles are thousands of acres of scenic drives, waterfalls, campsites and hiking trails, either along the meandering Delaware River or in Promised Land State Park, just 15 minutes south of Hawley, Wallenpaupack’s town center.</p>
					
					<p>The streets of Hawley are lined with Victorian homes and stores, tiny museums like Wayne County’s Historical Society shop and plenty of antiques and summer tag sales. There’s also bowling and movies, a historic train to the Delaware River and the Costas Family Fun Park.</p>
					
					<p>But the best part of Wallenpaupack is still the lake itself. Whether you take a dip or a sunset stroll, its presence demands a slower pace. If you visit this summer, you just might become another one of the regulars. Rachel Wharton</p>
					
					<p>Squam Lake, New Hampshire</p>
					
					<p>Perhaps you’ve heard of Squam, a calm New Hampshire lake of sparsely populated shores and quiet inlets, where the fishermen cast their lines in the predawn light and the loons dive for trout beyond the shallows. Squam is the more secluded cousin of nearby Lake Winnipesaukee and onetime cinematic backdrop for the 1981 drama “On Golden Pond.”</p>
					
					<p>The Oscar-winning film caused a surge in tourism, and a quarter-century later families still come here to revisit the cinematic ghosts of Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Others come simply for the lake’s peaceful panorama of rolling hills and glistening water.</p>
					
					<p>About a 5½ -hour drive from New York, the Squam Lake area consists of two bodies of water, Big Squam and Little Squam. Together, they contain 65 miles of winding shoreline and 30 islands. To the north lie the White Mountains, and buffering the lake is White Mountain National Forest, 780,000 acres of hiking and cross-country ski trails.</p>
					
					<p>To the south lies Lake Winnipesaukee, an immense lake flanked by housing developments and resort hotels. Squam has distinguished itself by limiting development on its shoreline and enforcing rules that restrict Jet Skis and other watercraft.</p>
					
					<p></p>“The reason you come to Squam Lake is for privacy,” Lisa Wardlaw, a 20-year resident, told me. “There are so many coves and inlets that each one is like its own little lake.”
					Because so many people return here year after year, finding a room in the summer can be a challenge. But if you plan ahead, there are many places to stay. Those in search of modest but friendly digs should try the Cottage Place, on the border between the towns of Ashland and Holderness. This two-story motel also rents eight private cottages with full kitchens, all facing Little Squam. At the end of the day, the picnic tables are the locus of conversation.</p>
					
					<p>The ritziest place in town (read: spa treatments and croquet) is the Manor on Golden Pond, a grand home on Shepard Hill overlooking the lakes. For a quiet getaway closer to the mountains, try Jonathan Beede House, a lovingly restored 1787 center-chimney Colonial on a quiet road in Mount Israel, near the town of Sandwich. Owners Susan and John Davies have decorated it with family antiques, heirloom quilts, antique hat boxes and watercolor paintings.</p>
					
					<p>For great local eats, try The Corner House in Sandwich, serving a variety of American fare. The Sandwich Cremery, tucked away in the nearby mountains, has superb homemade ice cream and cheese, and the Squam Lake Inn in Holderness makes boxed lunches to go.</p>
					
					<p>Squam Lake offers an endless list of activities. Squam Lake Tours launches cruises three times a day in the summer. Adventurous types can choose from miles of hiking trails or the Squam Lakes Natural Science Center, where you’ll find everything from bobcats to bald eagles. Or, check out the free public beaches in the Chamberlain-Reynolds Memorial Forest. The Squam Lake Association maintains a few islands on Big Squam for public use. If you have a boat or canoe and know where to look, said Capt. Buddy Nassar as we toured the lake, “You can usually find a beach and call it your own for a day.” Steve Bryant</p>
