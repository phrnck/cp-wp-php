					<h3>Beauty of New Hampshire on Display at The Cottage Place on Squam Lake</h3> 
					<h4>Perfect Location For Family to Relax and Get Away From It All</h4>
					<h4>HOLDERNESS, NH (June 6, 2003) - “Summertime and the livin’ is easy…”</h4>
					<p>When George Gershwin wrote the classic song “Summertime,” he could have had The Cottage Place on Squam Lake in mind. </p>
					<p>Completely refurbished and restored to the original beauty the late Milton Grayton created in 1957, The Cottage Place features eight pine-paneled, lakefront cottages ranging in size from one to six rooms. There are also eight charming cottage suites featuring kitchenettes. </p>
					<p>The project is a labor of love for owners Sue Palmer and her mother, Beverly Smith, who bought the property - previously known as the Black Horse Motor Court - in October 2002. 
“The interiors are rustic and charming and feel like an old New Hampshire lake home,” said Palmer. “We’ve restored original furniture of the era with crisp vintage fabrics and we have also brought back the original gardens, featuring roses and other beautiful flowers.” </p>
					<p>The Cottage Place boasts 140 feet of pristine private beach on 7,100-acre Squam Lake, the second largest lake in New Hampshire.  Squam was the setting for the Academy Awardä winning 1981 film “On Golden Pond,” which starred Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn, who both took home Oscarsä for their heartwarming performances. </p>
					<p>Palmer said a 400-square-foot white cedar playground system is being installed, featuring a tower and a gazebo. The Cottage Place also offers dock space for six boats and a classic floating raft for summer swimming fun. The lake is also a mecca for fisherman trying to outwit landlocked Salmon, Lake Trout and Bass. </p>
					<p>The New Hampshire Lakes region is also popular for hiking, horseback riding, antiquing, dining and shopping. In the winter, it is a great spot for skiing, with five major ski areas nearby including: Waterville Valley, Ragged, Loon Mountain, Tenney Mountain and Gunstock. </p>
					<p>Snowmobilers have access to both corridor #8 and #11 through local trails, and skaters, snowshoers and cross-country skiers love the winter wonderland. </p>
					<p>“We have a great desire to leave something much better than when we found it,” Palmer said. “We are so proud that a mother/daughter team could make this happen.” </p>
					<p>Palmer said she and her mother are focusing on top-notch hospitality and creating a cozy atmosphere.  “We are looking to become a family tradition for our guests for years to come, she said.  </p>
					<p>The Cottage Place on Squam Lake is located at 1132 U.S. Route 3 in Holderness. For more information, call 603.968.7116 or visit www.cottageplaceonsquam.com.</p>
