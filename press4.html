					<h3>The Squam Lakes Await You … A perfect Weekend Getaway</h3> 
					<h4>Sno-Traveler, Winter 2009</h4>
					<p>Holderness, NH - The Squam Lakes in Holderness, New Hampshire, a two hour drive from Boston, is a perfect place for a great snowmobile weekend get away. We have miles of well groomed trails with magnificent views, great restaurants; several easily accessible by snowmobile, and a great place to stay, park your trailer and pull your snowmobile up next to your cozy cottage where a warm fire is waiting inside. </p>
					
					<p>The Cottage Place (cottageplaceonsquam.com) boasts; 8, 2 room suites with full kitchens; 7 multi-room cottages, all with full kitchens, several with fire places and a 6 bed room lodge with a full kitchen and a large living room with a  fireplace that will accommodate up to15 people for a great group get away.  The Cottage Place is located on Little Squam Lake in Holderness and provides a great jumping off point for your weekend adventure.</p>
					
					<p>When you start your machine in the morning and head out Evans Cove on to the lake you can choose to go east or west. Going west will take you to the covered bridge at the west end of the lake; from here you can get to Annie’s Overflow Restaurant in Holderness for a fantastic country breakfast. After breakfast you can continue on and join NH snowmobile Route 11 north to Lincoln or backtrack to the trails maintained by The Squam Trail Busters (squamtraibusters.com). When you get to the junction you went left on to Annie’s go left on the trail to Sandwich Notch. This trail will take you up the back side of the Squam Range to Sandwich Notch; from there continue down to the shore Big Squam. Then you are free to explore the shores of the lake. Be sure to end up at the northwest corner of the lake where the village of Holderness is located. Take a quick hop over US Route 3 to the east end of Little Squam Lake where you will want to stop at Walters Basin and visit the BassHole for a Hot Buttered Rum. When you are sufficiently warmed head back out on the lake and continue west back to your cottage at the Cottage Place. The trip to Annie’s is about 20 minutes. The loop to Sandwich Notch, Squam and back to the Cottage Place is about 3 hours. </p>
					
					<p>If you made the choice to go east on Little Squam to the east end you will be back by Walter’s Basin. You can shop for staples at The General Store or go to The Golden Pond Country Store to fill up with gas and either head out on Big Squam to explore the lake or head south towards Meredith. On the way you will want to stop at The Mug for lunch and sample some of their unique sandwiches. Continuing south fro the Mug will take you to Meredith and access to Lake Winnipesauke.</p>
					
					<p>The Cottage Place not only offers you a warm, friendly place to stay but provides ample space to park your car/truck and trailer giving you the freedom to spend the weekend traveling on your snowmobile.</p>
